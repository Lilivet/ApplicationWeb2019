    <h3>Web development definition</h3>
    <p>
      In the WEB development community and industry, the development roles are splitted into three categories: "<em><strong>front-end development</strong></em>", "<em><strong>back-end development</strong></em>" and "<em><strong>full-stack development</strong></em>".
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend of a web application is an enabler for a frontend experience. An application’s frontend may be the most beautifully crafted web page, but if the application itself doesn’t work, the application will be a failure. The backend of an application is responsible for things like calculations, business logic, database interactions, and performance. Most of the code that is required to make an application work will be done on the backend. Backend code is run on the server, as opposed to the client. This means that backend developers not only need to understand programming languages and databases, but they must have an understanding of server architecture as well. If an application is slow, crashes often, or constantly throws errors at users, it’s likely because of backend problems.

      <p>In the article <a href= "https://learntocodewith.me/posts/backend-development/" target="_blank"><strong>"The Beginner´s guide to Backend development"</strong></a>, by "GoSkills", the author Krystal Tolany describes the different backend languages that are most used in the industry right now, why and how much an engineer specilized in that language might earn.</p>
